Richard,

I like the 'automated' mode the best, and have a few suggestions.

1. It would be best in the long run to have a single run of matmet restricted
   to handle (1) a single data type (e.g., PPT), and (2) a single type of
	source data set format (e.g., Tucson LTRR format). The user could be
	initially prompted for the input data set format.  From there, matmet
	would know whether the data type is encoded (as with Tucson LTRR), and
	would know how to transform to the desired units.  matmet would also know
   of any idiosyncrasies of missing data coding, etc., for the source data set.

2. Let's assume PPT will be wanted stored in mm, temperature in deg C, so
   matmet will automatically do that for the user.  If the user has his
	heart set on inches or whatever, he can easily scale back within his
	application in matlab


3. [.dta output] Longitude should be in map plotting convention (negative for W).  I see the
	Fresno source files do not have W or E in the header.  So matmet knowing it
	is working on LTRR format data, will have to prompt the user whether he
	wants all his longitudes coded negative (warned that if so his stations 
	should be west long).

4. Since all the data output will be of one type (e.g., ppt) and units, there
	is no need for the ?met.typ output file.  It would still be useful to retain
	a one-line (for now) ?met.typ file however.  Only I would have it for now
	just with two lines of text info:
		Line 1:  the data source (as read from the prompt (1) above)
		Line 2:  the data type (e.g., "PPT)

5.  The .log, .met, and .txt output files look fine


So, a matlab structure variable as I see it will contain a single
data type from a single data source.  Big complicated problems could be handled
by building multiple structures based on several runs of matmet. For example,
the user may want to have a strucure variable with a bunch of  HCN urban
heat island adjusted temperature stations, and another with HCN non-adjusted
temperature data.  But let's work out the bugs and build the design first to
handle the LTRR format met data (like Fresno)


Cheers, Dave

Richard,


I'm on the edge of my seat for the completion of the "Wisdom of the Spline"...


matmet is shaping up quite well.  Below are some comments


1.   .dta  looks good

2.	  .typ  looks good

3.	  .met would look ok, but I using file.lst, I read in bastard data:
    one file is ppt and one is temperature.  We need a new file.lst and
    corresponding input data files -- a couple of ppt stations and a couple
	 of temperature stations

4.  .log looks good, and shows that one of my files is tmp.  It would be good
    to have matmet flag the user if it can (which probably depends on the
source data set) that he is trying to read in data of different types

5.   The menu statement "Default is automatic (no prompts)" should 
	should say  '... no prompts for individual stations..'

6.  The opening statement about "Meteorologic data are read in ... format"
might be more general if it just says something like:

-----------
Currently acceptable data types:  P, T, PDSI .. or whatever
Currently recognized input data sets:
 LTRR;  Lamont Doherty;  HCN; ... or whatever
--------------------------------

Down the line, we could have a separate ascii text file that defines these
formats for the new user


7.  In automatic mode, can we use the "Source of Data" as a code to automatically have the program
   use the correct input units and digits.  For example, given "LTRR",
   and that the data type is "P",  matmet would know that the data are in 
   inches, with 2 digits to right of an implied decimal point. For LTRR
   data we would not know automatically that the latitude is "N" and longitude
	"W", but for other data sets, the "N" or "W" will be in header information.
	Thus specifying the data source and data type specifies the number of 
	succeeding prompts needed in automatic mode.
	

Cheers, Dave

Richard,

Below are responses to your question.
Dave


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I'm working on the changes you want to see.  On the KATI server I put
several precip and temp files under \TMP\DMEKO\PPT and ..\TMP   Most
of them do not have the standard header, but that is all I have for
the time moment.

1.  How can we tell reliably that data are of the same type?  Should
we look for a character string such as "TEMP" in the header?  .. or in
the file name?  I had assumed that the user would know and would
assemble only data of one type.  Should we look for data patterns that
would indicate the type of data?   I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR. WHAT I HAD 
IN MIND WAS THAT FOR THOSE DATASETS THAT HAVE CODE LIKE 'TEMP" IN 
THEIR HEADER, MATMET MIGHT CHECK FOR INCONSISTENCY BY WARNING A 
PERSON WHEN THEY TRIED, SAY, TO READ IN A MIX OF PPT AND TEMP FILES.  
IN THE CASE OF LTTRR FORMAT DATA, 'PPT' OR 'TEMP' IS READ OFF HEADERS 
FOR EACH SERIES.  BUT MORE GENERALLY, I WOULD PUT THE BURDERN ON      
THE USER TO MAKE SURE HE DID NOT MIX DATASETS/DATATYPES

2.  In "automatic" mode, should we have a single prompt for each
station, showing what the program has read from the header?  It would
then prompt for the following options:

        1   File and info OK, include
        2   File OK, need user input on info
        3   Reject file (not to be included)
I WOULD SAY NO.  AS THEY USED TO SAY "LET REAGAN BE REAGAN", LET'S 
"LET AUTOMATIC BE AUTOMATIC".  THIS BECAUSE USER MIGHT BE INPUTTING 
HUNDREDS OF STATIONS AT ONCE.


3.  What is HCN format?  I will try to get a couple of such files, or
can you e-mail me a few?
I JUST MEANT THAT AS AN EXAMPLE.  ACTUALLY THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF 
HCN DATA.  SOME HCN DATASETS HAVE BEEN REFORMATTED BY BOB L AND CAN 
BE RETRIEVED FROM TREE.  THESE MIGHT ALREADY BE IN "LTRR" FORMAT.  
USERS WILL UNDOUBTABLY WANT TO PROCESS  USHCN AND GLOBAL HCN DATA 
DOWNLOADED FROM NCDC.  THE DATASETS VARY GREATLY IN FORM.  SOME HAVE 
SEPARATE "SITE INFORMATION" FILES AND DATA FILES.  UNLESS YOUR'E 
AMBITIOUS, I WOULD HOLD OFF ON BUILDING IN THE CODE UNTIL WE DECIDE 
A PRIORITY OF HCN-TYPE DATA THAT MIGHT BE USED.  IF YOU ARE 
AMBITIOUS, CHECK OUT THE NCDC PAGE AND LOOK AT THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND 
ADJUSTED  MONTHLY USHCN TEMPERATURE DATASET.
