 seaspt:  seasonalize a monthly precipitation or temperature series
 F = seaspt(A,begmo,endmo,k);

</PRE>
 Converts monthly climatic data to seasonal data. For example,
 you might want an annual time series of precipitation grouped
 from September of the previous year through August of the current
 year for use in a climatic reconstruction model. Or maybe a time
 series of summer temperature (averaged of June,July,August).

 Before calling seaspt.m, you should have the monthly climate data in a
 13-column numeric matrix within Matlab, with the year as column 1. It's
 best that this missing-data be coded as NaN in this matrix.  That way,
 any seasonalized value relying on the missing data for any month will also
 be NaN.

*** INPUT

 A(? x 13)d  monthly ppt or tmp; year in col 1; Jan data in col 2 ... Dec in col 13
 begmo (1 x 1)i Begining month of season. Jan=1, Dec=12.
 endmo (1 x 1)i Ending month of season.   Jan=1, Dec=12.
 k (1 x 1)i option for type of variable
   k=1, A is ppt, runoff, effective ppt, or any variable summed over months
   k=2, A is temperature, pdsi, Z-index, or soil moisture
   Only difference is
		seasonalized ppt, etc,  is computed as sum over months,
     temperature, etc., is computed as average over months.

***  OUTPUT ARGUMENT
 F (? x 2)  Seasonalized ppt or temp.  First col is year of ending month
		of seasonal grouping.  Say begmo=11, endmo=1, and yrs=[1930 1950].
		Then beginning year of seasonalized series (Nov-Jan) is 1931, which
		is based on Nov and Dec of 1930 and Jan of 1931.
