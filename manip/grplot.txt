 grplot: multiple time series plots of ring width on a page
 grplot;
 Last revised 4-15-99

</PRE>
 grplot operates on ring-width data converted beforehand from a ".rwl" file
 to a ".mat" file using the UW-function rwlinp.m.   Up to eight ring-width
 series can be plotted on a page.  The user can plot the series in the same
 order they are stored in the original .rwl file, or can select or re-order
 series (by starting year is one option) before plotting.<P>

 The intended use of grplot is as an aid in deciding on the form of the
 growth curve to use in de-trending ring-width series.  Low-frequency
 ring-width fluctuations not shared by different trees are readily seen in the
 plots.  Removal of such fluctuations by the growth curve is probably
 reasonable. <P>

 grplot can optionally be run in two modes:  "single" or "batch".  Single mode
 applies to a set of ring-width series from one site.  Batch mode applies to
 multiple files of ring-width series, perhaps from several sites.  Single mode is
 interactive, with zoom capability on plots.  Batch mode is not interactive, but
 can generate .ps files, one per site, for later printing and viewing.<P>

*** IN ******************************************************

 No input arguments

 User prompted for various options, and to point to files for input and
 output

*** OUT *******

 No output args.

 File output is optional, and consists of one or more postscript (.ps) files, one for
 each input .mat ring-width file.  The user can specify the filename in interactive
 mode.  In batch mode, the .ps suffix is assigned to the same prefix as the input
 .mat file containing the ring-width file.

 In "single" mode you can view the figure windows as the program runs and afterwards.
 In "batch" mode, figure windows are not saved, but are overwritten from on
 ring-width file to ring-width file.  But in batch mode, have the plots stored in
 .ps files for later plotting.
