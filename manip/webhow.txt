webhow.txt how to update treetool directory

1. REVISING OR UPDATING ALL .M FUNCTIONS

-make sure all needed functions are listed in toolfls.txt
-run treecpy1.m to copy all those .m functions  to c:\mlb\treetool
-delete existing trunk.zip from c:\web
-run winzip 
	-new archive -- c:\web\trunk.zip 
	-add files to the archive
	-browse to c:\mlb\treetool\ and select *.m
-run com2html.m to build an html file with comments for all functions; say, c:\web\mflhtml.txt
-In Homepage,, \project\reopen project, and do the following:
  Project\reopen, if necessary
  File-New-Default Template >> edit mode
  Edit-SelectAll-Cut to delete all contents of this default template
  Click snippets icon; right-click mfilex in \web\snips\ & insert into the blank template
  If necessary, uncomment the css link in the snippet
  Put cursor in body of new file, and File-Insert-mhtml.txt
  Click projects icon to get rid of the snippets window
  File-Save as-C:\web\mfiles1.html... to overwrite existing file
  Change to browse mode, and test that you see the revised m-files
  Edit toolbox.html as needed so that function list hypertext works
-upload revised toolbox.html, mfiles1.html, and any other revised .html files to the server
-upload trunk.zip to server

2. REVISING BY ADDING A SINGLE NEW M-FUNCTION

-make sure the function's syntax conforms to toolbox specs
->cd c:\mlb\manip
-use treecpy1.m to copy the full list of toolsls.txt into c:\mlb\treetool, if not already there
-make another file-list file   toolone.txt with the new m-function path\name
-run treecpy1.m, point to toolone.txt, and send the m-function to c:\mlb\treetool\ondeck?\
-In matlab, change matlab path so only has c:\mlb\treetool\ and ...\treetool\ondeck\
-Try running the new function (possibly with profile on) to see if need other new
 UW files.  Check out profile report to see what those functions are
-If needed, add the other needed functions to toolone.txt and re-run treecopy1.m ... etc
(-If it finally works, append contents of toolone.txt to toolfls.txt so that next time
 will have ALL current toolbox files grabable at once)
-Run com2html.m , with toolone.txt , make result  c:\web\morehtml.txt; click on the new .m file
-if com2html.m bombs, correct new .m file in ORIGINAL DIRECTORY, NOT TREETOOL,  and recopy to treetool
-In Homesite,  Project-reopen project and do following
 Edit mfiles1.html by putting cursor just above the <\body> line near end of file
     then using File-Insert-morehtml.txt
 Edit the "List of Functions" section of toolbox.html to iclude reference to the new functions
 Test that can go to the List to the m-file & back with the hypertext
-In explorer, move the new function from \ondeck?\ to \treetool\, and winzip with all
 other toolbox functions into new trunk.zip; move trunk.zip to \web
-Copy trunk.zip and any revised html files  from \web to server
-Clean up by deleting morehtml.txt from \web and deleting \ondeck?\ and contents
