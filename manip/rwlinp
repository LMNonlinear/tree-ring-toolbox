 rwlinp:  convert ring-width .rwl data to indexed-vector storage form
 rwlinp(pf1,path1,path4);
 Last revised 3-18-97

</PRE>
 rwlinp is used to read a .rwl file of ring widths and to store the data in a .mat
 file in a form compatible with other functions in the Tree-Ring Matlab Toolbox.
 This converted form is an indexed vector, a column vector
 with ring widths for one series followed by those for the next, and so forth.
 Also stored is a matrix with years and row indices allowing retrieval
 of individual ring-width series, and a string matrix of core ids

 Indexed-vector (IV) storage is the format required by grplot.m, a function
 for plotting multiple ring-width series on a page.

*** INPUT

 pf1 (1 x ?)s path\filename of .rwl file
   example:  'd:\jack\data\az033.rwl'
 path1 (1 x ?)s path to the .rwl file.  If this arg is passed, means
   that pf1 is the filename only
   Example: 'd:\jack\data\'  as path1,  and   'az033.rwl' as pf1
 path4 (1 x ?)s <optional, only if also have pf1 and path1>: path
   for the output .mat files and .tmp files.  If no path4 as argument,
   default is to the same directory as the .rwl files are in

 Input arguments are optional.  There can be 0,1, 2, or 3 input arguments:
  None: user prompted to clck on names of input and output files
  One:  path\filename for the .rwl file
  Two: first arg is the filename of the .rwl file, and the second is the path
  Three: path for the output .mat file; this option is convenienent when user
    wants .mat output files to go to different directories that that
    of the source .rwl files

*** OUTPUT  *****************************************

 No arguments. Depending on the number of input arguments, the output .mat
 file goes to a specified path\filename or the user is prompted to enter
 it.  The .mat file contains three variables:

   X (? x 1)i  column vector of ringwidths stored one core after another
	  in units of hundredths of mm
   yrs (? x 3)i start year, end year, and row index of start year of each
	  core's ring-width series in X
   nms (? x 8)s  identification of each core

 A .tmp ascii file is also produced listing the core id, and first and last years'
 data for each core.  This file intended for checking that rwlinp.m
 indeed stores the ring widths properly
