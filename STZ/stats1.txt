STATS1.TXT -- describes function STATS1.M
Computes statistics on the standard and residual core indices.

***********************************************************************
CS1: columns contain, for each standard core index (rows):
	1. sequence number for the core
	2. start year of core index 
	3. end year of core index
	4. sample size (number of years)
	5. mean 
	6. mean sensitivity
	7. standard deviation

CE1: same as CS1, except for residual core indices

	Note on columns of CS1 and CE1:
		1 -this sequence number is the same as in the nms and yrs
			matrices in the original .mat file for the chronology.
			So, can get the core id from nms(i,:)
		2,3 - year interval is for the original core measurements
			as marked in yrs matrix in xxx.mat;  may contain NaNs;
			internal NaNs as a result of blocking; flanking NaNs as
			a result of truncating data or -- for residual series -- 
			as a result of loss of beginning values in AR modeling
		4 -sample size includes only non-missing values in the 
			specified year interval
		5 -arithmetic mean over years with non-missing data
		6 -mean sensitivity;  weighted by number of years if the 
			series is in segments as a result of blocking
		7 -standard deviation -- uses matlabs std.m

		BASIC1.M is called to get standard deviation and mean
		MEANSEN1.M is called for mean sensitivity

CS2, CE2 -- product-moment correlation coefficients between 
 		core indices

CS2 and CE2 are 5-column matrices containing correlation coefficients
and related information for non-redundant pairs of core indices. Each 
row corresponds to a pair of cores.  Columns are:

1. correlation coefficient
2. sample size on which correlation coefficient is computed
3. categorical variable marking whether the pair of cores is
	from the same tree (1) or from different trees (2)
4,5 sequence numbers (cross-referenced to nms) of the two cores

RTREE1.M is called to computer the correlations


***********************************************************************

CS3, CE3 -- mean correlation of core indices for cores from the same
tree and cores from different trees

CS3 and CE3 are 2 x 2 matrices:

	row 1 - mean correlation coef
	row 2 - sample size (number of correlation coefs averaged)
	col 1 - each core in pair is from different tree
	col 2 - each core in pair is from same tree
