Ringwidths were detrended by the ratio method, as described by
Cook et al. (1990), with the objective of producing a site
chronology for studying climate variations. Care was accordingly
taken to retain the low-frequency variability characteristic of
the entire site, and to de-emphasise tree-specific variability.
The first step in the detrending method used was automated curve
fitting with monotonic non-increasing curves (spline, straight
line with negative slope, or horizontal line) to remove any
gradual decrease in ringwidth over full length of series. The
second step was optional manual over-riding of the automated
curve-fit as needed to emphasize site-wide fluctuations. This
manual step optionally included truncating an individual
ring-width series, deleting it from the chronology, or modifying
its curve fit by selecting a more suitable detrending line (e.g.,
a stiffer spline (Cook and Peters 1981), or a horizontal line
instead of a straight line with a negative slope)

The final selected detrending curves are listed in table below.
Note that the table lists only those ring width series actually
used in the chronology; additional ring-width series, masked out
from the chronology building, might be included in the .rwl data
file sent to the ITRDB. After the trend line was fit, core
indices were computed by dividing the ring-width in each year by
the value of the fitted trend line. Core indices were then
averaged to get tree indices, and tree indices were averaged to
get a site index, or standard chronology. Averaging of tree
indices for a given year was by the arithmetic mean if fewer than
6 trees; otherwise by a bi-weight mean. The residual chronology
was computed in same way as the standard chronology except that
autoregressive residuals of core indices were used in place of
core indices. The "sample size" listed in attached ".crn" files
is the number of TREES sampled each year, not the number of
cores.
