% Compute indices for all series by negative slope combo method
% Set candidate gaussian smoothing filters: from 30yr to 0.75Nmax (wavelength of 0.5 freq resp)
%
% Loop over series
%   Loop over candidate lowpass filters
%       Smooth indices and store smoothed index in tsm as layer of a 3-D array
%   end loop
% End loop

% Loop over series, defining each in turn as "key"
