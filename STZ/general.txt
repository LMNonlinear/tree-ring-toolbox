CORE-NAMING CONVENTION

Functions treenum.m and maskind.m assume a specific naming and
numbering convention for cores.  

1. First 3 characters are the site code (e.g., PAD).  
2. The next up-to-three characters are the numeric tree number
   as numbered withing the site code (e.g., 4, 04, 004,101)
3. The single letter following the tree number is the core label
   (e.g., A, B, C)
4. The single letter could be followed by a number labeling a
   segment (e.g., A1)

   Examples of OK core ids:  PAD4A, PAD100B2, PAD04A

5. Cores from the same tree should be next to one another in 
   the .rwl file.  For example, cores PAD01A, PAD01B and PAD01C 
   should be together.  It is not necessary that cores be in 
   alphabetical order withing the tree-group.  So, for example, 
   the sequence PAD01B, PAD01C, PAD01A is OK.

6  A chronology can be built from an RWL file that contains cores
   from multiple sites as marked by 3-letter site codes.  For example,
   A chronology for the Galiuro Mtns might have cores from 
   Paddys River (PAD) and Douglas Canyon (DCY).  The trees from 
   different sites sites should not be intermingled in the .rwl file.

7. Here is an example of an acceptable sequence of core ids:

	PAD1A
	PAD2A
	PAD03A
	PAD3B
	PAD101C1
	DCY13A
	DCY13B
	DCY24A
	DCY7A
	DCY7B


****************************************
SETTING UP NECESSARY FILES

-Make a directory c:\uttey\ , and put in it the following tree-ring DOS programs:
  convert.exe
  dpl.exe
  dosxmsf.exe
-Modify your autoexec.bat file so the path includes c:\uttey\

convert.exe is for converting .rw files to a single .rwl file.  dpl.exe has
"sur", "cofecha" and lots more useful tree-ring utilities
dosxmsf.exe is needed to let the DOS programs work on huge data files

*********************************************************

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS FOR STANDARDIZING

By way of example, for Scheelite Canyon PSME collection
Starting point is a set of .rw files for the site

Set up a working directory right under the root to
do this analysis. I use c:\work\

Copy all .rw files to be used to C:\work;   
Make c:\work your current directory, and be in a dos window

[DOS] convert ..... to get rwl file  slc96.rwl

Delete all the copied .rw files from c:\work, leaving just slc96.rwl

[DOS]  dpl--sur... to run the program sur under program library;
	will get slcsur.out output file;  print this for reference;  see
	that have 59 cores, oldest starting in 1635; last year on any 
	core 1995

	dpl--cofecha... default options except ask for listing of measurements
		gives slccof.out

[WORD] Open slccof.out in one window; copy  Part 5 (sliding correls)
	to another window;  close slccof.out window;  
	-Select all/ format to courier 8-pt, bold; parag line spacing 
	 exactly 6 pt
	-Paginate if needed, cutting and pasting heading for readability
	-print out the document with Part 5 (sliding correlations)

[NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS]  Want to get full printout of cofecha 
output at ccit.  Here's how.
-Click on ewan vax icon and open session on vax
-Use winftp, using the host vms.ccit.arizona.edu,  username dmeko
 password   ribets
-Pull cofecha output up to vax
-use script     pccit slccof.out  to print it
-delete file from vax, log off, get out of network communications
-pick the output up at ccit

Cofecha output: possible problem in dating of earliest part of
oldest cores, especially 21a.  Copied  .rw files for 31a, 21b, 22a over
to d:\work for closer look

[MATLAB] rwsook on  21a vs 22a shows possible problems before 1670.
21a might have some missing values in drought of 1660's to 1670. Plots
on chronology indices for santa ritas, catalinas, chiricahuas show
gross disagreements pre 1670.  Could some or all have dating problems?

***************
[MATLAB-RWLINP.M] on slc96.rwl to get slc96.mat, which stores
indices and reference info in form matlab functions can use

   X    9630 by 1          9630     77040       Full      No 
 nms      59 by 8           472      3776       Full      No 
 yrs      59 by 3           177      1416       Full      No 

 X is a col vector of ringwidths for all 59 cores, one core 
 after another in order as in slc96.rwl 

 nms is string matrix identifying the 59 cores

 yrs is first year, last year, and row index to first year's value
	in X


******************
GRPLOT1  on slc96.mat to get grouped timeseries plot of the 59 
core ring-width series.  These plots are useful in deciding on
curve fits.

Gives up to 8 plots per figure.  slc96 data set therefore gives
8 figure windows to cover the 59 series.  Look at these on the
screen one by one, and print out with   'print -dps'


********************************
CRVFIT.M -- growth-trend modeling.  Model each ring-width series.
Save result in slc96.mat

S 59 x 22    stores the curve-fit info
