1Core: Identifies site, tree and core
2seq.: Sequence # of core in .rwl ring-width storage file
3Period: Start and end year of period used to fit detrending curve
4Type: Curve type used in detrending:
  NE - modified negative exponential
  CS - cubic smoothing spline
  HL - horizontal line through sample mean
5Parameters: parameters of detrending curve; definition depends on curve type
  NE: equation y=k + a*exp(-b*(t-start))
      where y is smooth curve value in 100ths of mm
        k, a, and b are parameters fit by least squares
        t is the year, and
        start is the first year of the fit period (column 3 this table)
  SL: equation y=a + b*(t-tstart)
      where y is smooth curve value in 100ths of mm
        a and b are parameters fit by least squares
        t is the year, and
        start is the first year of the fit period (column 3 this table)
  CS: cubic spline parameter and properties
      k = spline parameter
      a = period (years) at which amplitude of frequency response of spline equals b
      b = amplitude of frequency response at period "a" years
  HL: Horizontal line information
      k = mean ring width for the period listed in columns 3 and 4
6Information on autoregressive model used to generate residual core index
  p = order of the model
  Ratio = ratio of variance of residual index to variance of standard index
      (high persistence in standard index corresponds to a low ratio
