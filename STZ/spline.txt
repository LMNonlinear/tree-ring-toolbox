SPLINE FIT

Following Granger and Hatanaka (1964, p. 132), "it has been found to 
be useful by the author to consider as 'trend' in a sample of size
n all frequencies less than 1/(2n) as these will all be monotonic
increasing if the phase is zero..."

Accordingly, a reasonable choice for spline stiffness is to specify
that the smooth curve have an amplitude frequency response of
0.99 at a period 2n.  Appreciable variance that would be regarded as 
trend by G&H's criterion would then not be left in the residual series
from the spline.

By trial and error, I found that the 2.00/0.99 criterion is
about the same as a .6342/.5 or a 0.201/0.01 criterion.  The 2/0.99 
spline would therefore have an amplitude frequency response of 0.5 at
63.42% of the series length, and a response of 0.01 at 20.1% of the
series length.  Some damping of variance at intermediate frequencies
is unavoidable.  The 2/0.99 fit will have almost no effect on
waves shorter than 20% of the series length.  Thus, applying the
2/.99 fit to a 500-year series will not appreciably damp 100-year
cycles.


Option for iteratively-fit non-increasing spline written 6-20-95.
The reason for this option is that for geometric reasons we might 
expect a monotonic decline in ring width over the age of the tree.
On top of this might be a slowdown in growth because of a decline
in vigor.  Why this instead of the modified negative exponential?
Because why should we expect the combined age weakening and
geometric influences to jointly give a mathematical decline following
the neg exponential?  Ring width plots often show plateaus and
shelves in ring-width.  These features are poorly modeled by the 
negative exponential.  Where the ring-width decline does look like a
negative exponential, the spline can suitably mimic the neg exponential.
When spline with 0.5 AFR at period of 2N years has positive slope
(increasing rinwidth with time), pgm does not attempt to iterate,
but accepts that spline and gives a warning message.
