 grplot: multiple time series plots of ring width on a page
 grplot;
 Last revised 4-15-99

</PRE>
 grplot plots "groups" of ring-width series, several to a page. The plots
 are similar to what used to be produced by the mainframe "pageplot" program.
 Up to eight series can be plotted per page.  The user can control which
 series are plotted and in what order. The default is in order as the
 series are stored in the original .rwl file. A useful option is to select
 ordering by start year of the series.<P>

 The intended use of grplot is as an aid in deciding on the form of the
 growth curve to use in ARSTAN or other standarization programs.
 Low-frequency ring-width fluctuations not shared by different trees are
 spotted in the plots. It's usually a good idea to remove such fluctuations in
 standardizing. <P>

 grplot can optionally be run in two modes:  "single" or "batch".  Single mode
 applies to a set of ring-width series from one site.  Single mode is most
 interactive (with zoom options) and is the most likely mode. Batch mode applies to
 multiple files of ring-width series, perhaps from several sites. Batch mode is
 not interactive, but is useful if you have to plot series from many sites.  In
 batch mode, .ps files, one per site, for later printing and viewing.<P>

*** IN ******************************************************

 No input arguments

 User prompted for various options, and to point to files for input and
 output

*** OUT *******

 No output args.

 File output is optional, and consists of one or more postscript (.ps) files, one for
 each input .mat ring-width file.  The user can specify the filename in interactive
 mode.  In batch mode, the .ps suffix is assigned to the same prefix as the input
 .mat file containing the ring-width file.

 In "single" mode you can view the figure windows as the program runs and afterwards.
 In "batch" mode, figure windows are not saved, but are overwritten from on
 ring-width file to ring-width file.  But in batch mode, have the plots stored in
 .ps files for later plotting.
