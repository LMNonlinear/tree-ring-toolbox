meansen1.txt:   plan for meansen1.m -- mean sensitivity

Source:  Fritts (1976, p. 258, eqn 6.5)

Mean sensitivity is computed for a time series.  The series
might be continuous with no NAs in the simplest case, but
might also have leading or trailing NAs, or have internal
blocks of NAs, and so be segmented.

meansen1.m handles the case of leading or trailing NAs by dropping 
the NAs from the series before proceeding with the analysis.
meansen1.m handles the case of a segmented times series by
(1) computing ms separately for each segment, and (2) weighting
the segment ms-values by their sample size (number of years) to
get a single ms value for the core.

meansen1.m will eventually be called from stats1.m twice:  (1) on the standard
core indices, and (2) on the residual core indices.  The core indices 
are contained within the XI and EI strung-out vectors.  The 
matrix yrs has the row indices needed to pull out the individual core
indices from XI or EI.  As pulled out, the core indices could have
NAs on the ends or in internal blocks.
