SITEI.M  --  build site index



*******************************************************


CRVFIT2.M -- produce standard core indices
   
ARRES.M -- AR model standard core indices to get residual core indices

STATS1.M -- statistics on core indices;  separately for std and resids

	BASIC1.M -- basic statistics: mean, standard deviation
	MEANSEN1.M -- mean sensitivity
	RTREE1.M -- correlations between cores
	RTREE2.M -- average correlations
		[average r for pairs of cores from different trees]
		[average r for pairs of cores from same tree] 
	
	On exiting, STATS1.M optionally adds six matrices to xxx.mat
			CS1, CE1, CS2,CE2, CS3, CE3


COREMASK.M -- build mask for user to specify whether or not to include
  core indices in the chronology.  User will base decision on statistics
  and other information gained so far.  Only the unmasked series will
  be used in subsequent analyses.

  On exiting, COREMASK.M optionally adds the mask "cmask" to xxx.mat

INDEX1.M -- convert core indices to tree indices

	TREENUM.M -- gets information for grouping cores into trees
		Scans nms; applies msk (from COREMASK.M) to pull out only 
		the rows (cores) desired from nms; from the resulting
		possibly trimmed version of nms:
			determines the number of trees
			makes a string matrix of tree names
			assigns a tree tag (sequence number
				cross-referenced to the names matrix) to each core
		Returns Tnms, Ti, Tn


	MEANTREE.M  -- Converts standard core indices, as culled by 
		the mask from COREMASK.M, into tree indices by averaging all
		available core indices for each tree in each year. 

	Upon leaving INDEX1.M, the following matrices will be optionally
	saved by adding to xxx.mat
			
			IT, ET: tree indices as strung-out vectors
			ITyrs, ETyrs:  year info, analogous to yrs for IX
			Tnms: tree id info, analogous to nms
			ITn, ETn: strung out vector same size as IT with
				number of cores that the IT or ET values are
				 based on

	Unlike X and IX, the strung-out col vectors IT and ET are not
	constrained to be the same size. Trailing and leading NaNs are
	removed in building IT and ET.  Usually ET will have more values
	removed because of loss of startup values in the ar modeling.

		

STATS2.M -- statistics on tree indices
	[between tree correlation]
	[EPS statistic]
	[SSS statistic]
	[mean sensitivity]
	[acf and pacf]


INDEX2.M -- generate site indices from tree indices
        	[tsm with year, std index, n of trees, 
			std deviation of std index]
		[same for residual index]
	
STATS3.M  -- statistics on site indices
		[mean sensitivity]
		[autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation coefs]
		

TRLFORM.M -- convert site indices and other matrices into ASCII
	files in tree-ring-lab (TRL) format
