Standardization steps: 1) measured ring width transformed as
needed to remove dependence of variance on mean, 2) trend line
(age curve) fit to transformed ring width, 3) core index computed
as difference of transformed ring width and age curve, 4) tree
index computed as average of core indices for each tree, 5) site
index (standard chronology) computed as mean of tree indices (or
as biweight mean if six or more trees in year). Residual
chronology computed likewise except that autoregressive residuals
of core indices used in step 4. 

Ring-width transformation in (1) above selected from family of
commonly used power transformations using slope of
spread-versus-level plot as guide (Hoaglin et al. 1983).
Candidate transformations include log10, and ring width raised to
various powers: -2, -1, -2/3, -1/2, -1/3, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 1 (no
transformation), 2, 3. Graphical quality control used to avoid
over-transformation. Smallest nonzero measured ring width added
if necessary before transformation to avoid infinite values in
transformed series. Transformed series linearly scaled and
shifted such that minimum and median of transformed ring width
equal minimum and median of measured ring width. This procedure,
called "matching", is described by Hoaglin et al. (1983, p. 114)

Detrending in two passes. First pass is automatic fitting of the
most flexible possible cubic smoothing spline that is monotonic
non-increasing throughout and that has a decreasing curvature
(positive second derivative) over the second half of the series.
This spline is achieved by iteratively increasing the spline
parameter, starting with a spline whose amplitude of frequency
response is 0.5 at a wavelenth twice the sample length.

Second pass is optional manual overriding of the automatic
curve-fits guided by review of time series plots of the fitted
trend line overlaid on the ring widths. This step taken to avoid
curves that are overly flexible, or that clearly track
non-age-trend ring-width variations in longer series. Most often
this manual step consists of specifying a "stiffer" spline than
arrived at in the first pass, or sometimes a horizontal line (no
detrending) or modified negative exponential. 

Core indices linearly shifted and scaled before averaging into
tree indices to make difference-method indices compatible for
statistical merging with ratio-method indices. The scaling is a
shifting of the mean of the core index to 1.0. The scaling is
multiplication of the departures from the mean such that the
variance of the difference index is equal to the variance of a
ratio index computed using the same ring-width data and
detrending curve.  

Table below lists the power transformation and detrending
option used for each ring-width series.
