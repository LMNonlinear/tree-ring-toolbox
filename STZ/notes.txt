- rwlinp.m to store ring widths from .rwl file in a .mat file as 
  strung-out column vector X with associated core ids in nms and 
  row-indexing and years in yrs

- grplot1 on ice.mat to get grouped time series plots of ring width 
  for various cores

- cfit1.m  to select curve fits:

  * store curve-fit info matrix S along with previous contents of
    ice.mat in ice1.mat

- cfit2. to non-interactively compute the standard core indices
  * pick cfit1.mat as input
  * in response to prompt, save as new file ice2.mat
  * ice2.mat now holds everything from ice1.mat plus IX

	IX -- strung out vector of core indices corresp to X
	  Missing value codes have been put in slots for some
	  years, depending on whether blocked out in curve
	  fitting

 	?? need to check that curve fits use the period specified
     	in S(:,10:12), not in yrs

- arres.m for AR modeling to get residual core indices
  * Point to ice2.mat as input
  * in response to prompt, save in ice2.mat
  * ice2.mat now holds old data plus EX and P

    EX -- AR-residual tree-ring indices for cores; strung-out vector
	same size as X and IX, with additional missing values where
	to allow for startup of AR modeling

    P, by column
     1 seq number of core
     2-3 begin, end year of core ring widths
     4 model order
     5 variance ratio :  estim errors to original series
     6-10 parameter estimates
     11-13 acf at lags 1-3
     14-16 pacf at lags 1-3
  

    ?? should years in col 2 be adjusted for fit of AR model?
    ?? need to check indexing. AR fit should be using period specified
	in S(:,10:12), not whole period as specified in yrs
    ?? need to add a col to P to store 95% conf limit on first-order r
	for one-tailed test (see acf.m)

- stats1.m for statistics on core indices
 CS1 -- basic stats on standard indices; CE1, same for residual core indices
    1 - seq number of core
    2 - start year of core
    3 - end year of core
    4 - number of years in core
    5 - mean
    6 - mean sensivity 
    7 - standard dev
 CS2, CE2:  between-core correl coefficiets;  Columns:
    1 - coefficient
    2 - sample size (time-series length)
    3 - 1 if the cores from same tree, 2 if from different trees
    4,5 - sequence numbers of the two cores
 CS3, CE3: mean between-core correlation coefficient
    Row 1: the average correlation
    Row 2: the number of corr coeffs the average is based on
    Col 1: cores from different trees
    Col 2: cores from same tree


***** REVISION OF CURVE FITS -- SAY WANT TO CHANGE ONE CURVE-FIT

- cfit1, using as input ice1.mat
  * store result back in ice1.mat, S will have been changed
 
- cfit2.m on ice1.mat:  
  * store result in ice2.mat; now have revised set of standard core
    indices

- any subsequent functions -- eg., arres.m, stats1.m,  



**********************  END OF COMPUTATION OF CORE INDICES

After finished revising curve fits, cfit2.mat holds the final core indices
and statistics.  The next step is to convert these core indices to tree
indices, then to get the tree-indexnc statistics.  



*****************************************************************


bldmask.m on ice2.mat to mask out cores from chronology. The tree
  indices will be based on the data set minus those cores.
  This decision based on statistics, quality of cores, length, etc.
  Optionally added to ice2.mat is 
 
  msk -- col vector, elements 1 except 0 if the core is to be masked
