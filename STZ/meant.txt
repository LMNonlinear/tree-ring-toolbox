Done separately for standard and residual core indices
Take case for standard core indices -- IX

- To start with, have 
	IX - strung out vector of core indices
	nms - names for the cores
	yrs - years and starting row subscripts for cores within IX

	(next series had been returned by TREENO.M)
	Ti - col 1 is tree sequence;  col 2 is original sequence number
		of this core within yrs and nms
	Tnms - tree names
	Tn - number of trees, equal to row size of Tnms

* Loop over the Tn trees for some initialization info
	* determine the number of cores for each tree
	* determine the beginning and ending years for the tree index
* Calculate the length of the strung-out
		vector IT, and initialize by filling with NaNs;
		also initialize ITn as NaN
* Calculate the starting and ending row indices of IT 
		in which the tree indices for each tree will be stored
* Loop over the Tn trees to compute tree indices and put in proper slots
	in IT and ET
	* if one core for this tree
			- get the core index from IX
			- place the core index in the proper slot in IT
			- set values of sample size (ITn) to "1" where
				core index is non-missing, NaN where core index is NaN
	* if more than one core for this tree
		- initialize two temporary column vectors of zeros, each the 
			same length as calculated length for this tree index. One
			vector is for data, the other for sample size
		- loop over cores for the tree
			- get the core index; from row entry in yrs and start and
				end years for this tree index (from previous loop), know
				which slots within the temporary vector to put this series
			- add the series to the proper row slots of the first zero
				vector
			- increment the sample size vector
	   - if final sample size in a year is zero, replace the zero in 
			the sample-size vector with NaN, and the zero in the data
			vector with NaN
		- if sample size >0, no change needed for the slot in the 
			sample-size vector, but divide the value in the data 
			vector by its sample size to get the mean 
		- place the final vector of tree index and tree-index sample
				size into proper slots in IT and ITn
