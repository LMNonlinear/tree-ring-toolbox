This chronology is intended for inferring moisture variations at
multi-decadal time scales. Ringwidths were detrended by the ratio
method, as described by Cook et al. (1990), using a 200-year
cubic smoothing spline as the default detrending curve. The
amplitude of the frequency response of this spline is 0.50 at a
wavelength of 200 years. Time series plots showed ring-width
variations at wavelengths longer than 200 years were largely
asynchronous across trees. A two-pass approach was taken to
detrending. The first pass was automatic initial detrending by
the default curve choice. The second pass was optional manual
over-riding of the default choice from viewing of superposed time
series plots of smoothed indices from multiple trees. This manual
step might include truncating an individual ring-width series,
deleting it from the chronology, or modifying its curve fit by
selecting a more suitable detrending line (e.g., a stiffer spline
(Cook and Peters 1981), or a horizontal line instead of a
straight line with a negative slope)

The final selected detrending curves are listed in table below.
Note that the table lists only those ring width series actually
used in the chronology; additional ring-width series, masked out
in the chronology building, might be included in the .rwl data
file sent to the ITRDB. After the trend line was fit, core
indices were computed by dividing the ring-width in each year by
the value of the fitted trend line. Core indices were then
averaged to get tree indices, and tree indices were averaged to
get a site index, or standard chronology. Averaging of tree
indices for a given year was by the arithmetic mean if fewer than
6 trees; otherwise by a bi-weight mean. The residual chronology
was computed in same way as the standard chronology except that
autoregressive residuals of core indices were used in place of
core indices. The "sample size" listed in attached ".crn" files
is the number of TREES sampled each year, not the number of
cores.
