Sample size in .crn file is the number of trees              
rather than the number of cores.                             
Core indices computed as the ratio of ringwidth              
to fitted trend line.  Core indices averaged to              
to form tree indices.  Tree indices averaged to              
to form site index.  Bi-weight mean used if 6 or             
more trees in a given year.  Otherwise chron                 
computed by arithmetic mean. Residual chron                  
computed likewise, except from autoregressive                
residuals of core indices.  All ringwidth series             
used in chronology are listed in table below,                
with sufficient information to allow independent             
researcher to duplicate construction of site                 
chronology from the ringwidths in the .rwl file

Fit Period = period of ring width used in curve fitting      
  * = differs from full available period of ring width data  
Curve Fit = type of model used to detrend ring width         
  NE=modified negative exponential                           
  SL=least-square-fit straight line                          
  HL=horizontal line at mean of ring width for fit period    
  CS=cubic smoothing spline                                  
     (Wavelength of 50% frequency reponse in parentheses)    
Persistence = autoregressive prewhitening information        
  AR(q) = order q of autoregressive model fit to core index  
  nn  = decimal proportion of core-index variance due to     
     persistence; computed as 1-R, where R is the ratio of   
     variance of residual index to variance of standard index
