*****************
  Higher Order Spectral Analysis Toolbox 2.0

  Currently shipping but only available for the MAC and PC platforms.
  The CD-ROM update is expected but no date as of yet.

  BACKGROUND
  The toolbox contains specialized tools for signal processing with
  higher-order spectra. It provides access to algorithms at the
  forefront of signal processing technology. Because many real-world
  signals are non-Gaussian, conventional estimation methods such as the
  autocorrelation or power spectrum do not use all the information available
  in those signals.   Higher-order spectra, which are defined in terms
  of the higher-order moments or cumulants of a signal, contain this
  additional information. 

  Higher-order spectra have many useful properties.  For example, they
  can suppress additive colored Gaussian noise of unknown power
  spectrum; identify nonminimum phase systems, and detect and
  characterize nonlinear properties in signals.

  What's New:
        o Cross-cumulant and cross-bispectrum estimation
        o Bicoherence and cross-bicoherence estimation
        o Cumulant methods for AR and MA model order determination  
        o Second-order Volterra model estimation  
        o Impulse response estimation using the cross-bicepstrum 
        o Theoretical bispectrum and trispectrum of a linear process
        o Higher-order time-frequency distributions, including
          second-order Wigner Spectra, sliced Wigner Bispectra and Wigner
          Trispectra, and optional Choi-Williams smoothing.

Question: How to incorporate Greek letters in MATLAB graphs?

  Can anyone tell me how to write Greek letters delta, and omega with
  subscripts and superscripts (like in LaTex \delta_{1,n}) in xlabel, ylabel?

  Thanks in advance.

  Swapan Saha
  ssaha@iastate.edu

Answer from Doug Schwarz:

  My Styled Text Toolbox will do this.  Use

      sxlabel('\delta_{1,n}')

  It is available from

  ftp://ftp.mathworks.com/pub/contrib/graphics/stextfun/

  Doug Schwarz
  Eastman Kodak Comapny
  schwarz@kodak.com

Answer from Carolyn Romano:

  There is also a way in MATLAB to use the hexidecimal equivalant of
  the Greek characters you want to incorporate.

  To place Greek characters in a plot, use the symbol font.  For
  example:

        plot(1:10)
        text(5,5,'a*b','FontName','symbol')

  This will place "alpha times beta" in the plot.

  To determine the character mapping of the symbol font, use chart.m.
  chart.m displays the hexidecimal values for the characters in the
  symbol font.  It is available via anonymous ftp.

    ftp://ftp.mathworks.com/pub/tech-support/library/graphics/chart.m

  Below is an example of how to use it:

        chart('symbol')
        % Find the last value for the characters you want to use.
        % For this example, I grabbed alpha(16) and beta(26).
        X_coordinate = [6 6];  % [alpha beta]
        Y_coordinate = [1 2];  % [alpha beta]
        a = setstr(16*X_coordinate(1)+Y_coordinate(1));
        b = setstr(16*X_coordinate(2)+Y_coordinate(2));
        str = [a,'*',b];
        plot(1:10)
        text(5,5,str,'FontName','symbol')

Question: How to create a surface of revolution in MATLAB?

  I created a data file, which is a simulated result, by using MATLAB.
  I plot the data in x-y coordinate system.
  Now I want to plot the data by using the SURF (3-D plotting) by rotating the
  data 360 degrees with 5 degree steps.
  For example, if I rotate 360 degrees with 5 degree steps for data generated
  by the sin(x) function, the data becomes a cone type function.
  How can I do it ?

  Thanks,
  Thomas Y. Lee (5L78LEEY@VMS.CSD.MU.EDU)

Answer from Kris Geising:

  You can create a surface of revolution in MATLAB by 1) using the 'cylinder'
  command; or 2) exploiting polar coordinates.

    % First example, part 1:

    % create a Gaussian curve
    a = exp(-([-2:.2:2]).^2);
    % create the surface of revolution; 20 pts around each radius
    [x,y,z] = cylinder(a, 20);
    % display the surface
    h = surf(x,y,z);

  You may want to rotate this object.  In this case, you can use the
  'rotate' command to rotate the resulting object so that the
  orientation is the desired one.  For example, this will display the
  surface of revolution about the X axis:

    % First example, part 2:

    % rotate current surface about the Y axis
    rotate(h, [-90 0], 90);

    % do some manipulation just to illustrate the object's position
    view([-5 30]);
    xlabel('X Axis');
    ylabel('Y Axis');
    zlabel('Z Axis');

  If the revolution is to be performed about the dependent variable
  axis, then the solution will not be in a form obtainable by
  'cylinder'.  However, you still easily create the surface of
  revolution.  Here's the second example:

    % create polar coordinates
    [theta, rho] = meshgrid(0:.1:2*pi, 0:.1:4);
    % create z data.  Notice that z vs. rho is again a Gaussian curve.
    z = exp(-(rho-2).^2);
    % translate to cartesian coordinates
    [x,y] = pol2cart(theta,rho);
    % display result
    surf(x,y,z);

  You should be able to create a surface of revolution for any function
  using one of these two methods.

Carolyn's Desk

  With the advent of Windows 95, some idiosyncrasies with MATLAB 4.2c and
  the Student Edition of MATLAB 4.0 have come to our
  attention. Technical Support has written a Technical Note
  dealing with these idiosyncrosis.  The current problems and
  solutions are listed below.  For an up-to-date listing, point
  your browser to:

      http://www.mathworks.com/1110.html

  Q1: Every time I try to save files with a .m extension, they show up
      having a.txt or .m.txt extension. 

  S1: In Windows 95, if you are hiding the DOS extensions for
      'registered' filenames, you aren't allowed to change the
      filename extension. For example, if you edit a text file 
      with the registered extension .txt, and you save it as file2.m,
      it actually gets saved as file2.m.txt. 

      To register .m as a viable extension, please do the following: 

       Open up your Computer.
       Click on the View menu.
       Choose Options.
       Choose File Types.
       Select New Type.
       Type M-file in the Description of type field.
       Type .m in the Associated extension field.
       Click on New to open the Actions window.
       Type open with Notepad in the Action field.
       Use the Browse button to find notepad.exe for the application.
       used to perform action field 
       Click OK to close New Action window 
       Click OK to close the File Type window 

       You can now save text files with a .m extension.

  Q2:  When I try to run the Student Edition of MATLAB, I receive the
       following error: 

             warning: bad handle to destroy_handle

  S2:  This problem relates to the FPU emulator that we ship with the
       Student Edition. Our Development staff is aware of the
       incompatibility with MS Windows 95 and we are currently
       investigation the issue. This section will be updated as soon
       as the information becomes available. 

       Note: If your computer has a math coprocessor, this is not an issue. 

  Q3: The Notebook does not work with Word 7.0. 

  S3: This is a known problem that our developers are
      investigating. Currently the workaround is to use Word 6.0, which can
      be used with Windows 95.  

  Q4: If a figure window is maximized, gtext and zoom will not display
      changes until the window is refreshed, for example, by changing
      the size of the window.   

  S4: There is no workaround at this time. 

  Q5: The immovie command and hdfpeek commands cause a general
      protection fault.  

  S5: There is no workaround at this time.

  Q6: Problems creating and/or running stand-alone executables. 

  S6: 
        o Compiling under Metaware: 

          Executables cannot be created using the "banging out" feature
          (i.e., using the '!' character). Instead, you must compile
          the applications at the DOS prompt.  

        o Compiling under MSVC: 

          When you run stand-alone applications, you need to bang out and
          use the start command (i.e., !start foo). 

        o Compiling under WATCOM, Borland, and NDP: 

          Stand-alone programs can be compiled and/or executed by banging
          out of MATLAB without a problem. 

  Q7: Problems creating MAT-files. 

  S7: 
        o Compiling under Borland: 

          matOpen won't create MAT-files. Also, when compiling,
          several error messages are generated, for example, 

         "Error: Fixup overflow at _TEXT:0x****, target =
         _FUNCTION_NAME_in module FOO.C"


         There is no workaround at this time. 

        o Compiling under NDP: 

          Creating MAT-files causes a general protection fault.

          There is no workaround at this time. 

        o Compiling under MSVC, WATCOM and Metaware: 

          MAT-files can be created without a problem. 

  Q8: Problems creating MEX-files. 

  S8: 
        o Compiling under NDP FORTRAN: 

          clear mex causes a General Protection Fault. We cannot
          determine if the reason is an accumulation of MEX-files or
          one specific one. 

          There is no workaround at this time. 

        o Compiling C MEX-files. 

          Seems to work fine with all compilers

pub/contrib/graphics/help/

 UIHELP is a utility that helps GUI designers provide online help
 in their GUI's.  When run on a figure it creates an M-file such
 that if attached to the keypressfcn, pressing the 'h' key while
 the cursor is above any uicontrol in the figure will pop up a
 help message.  The message is initially set to a default, but
 as the location of each uicontrol is marked with its TAG and
 STYLE in the M-file, changing the help strings to contain useful
 information should be an easy task.

pub/contrib/simulink/ansim/

 The Simulation Animation Toolbox is a collection of
 functions used to animate simple objects based on inputs
 from a SIMULINK simulation.  Animation and setup are implemented in a
 Graphical User Interface (GUI) environment
 that allows the user to be "hands off" the SIMULINK
 simulation.

 Users can choose five object types 
 available for animation: dot, line, patch, text, and
 rectangle.  Each  object type has properties that can
 either be constant values or be dependent upon an input from
 the SIMULINK simulation.  Any number of objects may be added,
 modified, or deleted.

 Other functionality that has been builtin to the
 Animation block includes the ability to control a number of
 axis parameters and the ability to save and load animation
 setups.

New Internet Service      Dave Pascoe <pascoe@mathworks.com>

  Back in July I mentioned that we intended to provide more access to
  the USENET newsgroup comp.soft-sys.matlab by setting up a public
  news server. I sent out a survey and many of you responded with interest.

  I am pleased to announce that this service is now available to those
  of you who have no current access to a USENET news server (NNTP server)
  at your organization.

  Here are the instructions for accessing the server:

  1) You need software for accessing USENET News.  This can be either a 
     news reading program or a WWW browser such as Netscape.

  2) In your news reading program or WWW browser, enter the following
     host name as your "news server":  www.mathworks.com

     If you are using a WWW browser, you can also simply access our
     server by entering the following URL:    news://www.mathworks.com 

  3) You also need to specify a "mail server".  This is any SMTP 
     (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server that will allow you to send
     e-mail from your computer.  Contact your local site administrator(s) for
     the address of your SMTP server.  If your site sends e-mail on the 
     Internet, it has an SMTP server.

  4) Open a connection to the server and you should see the 
     comp.soft-sys.matlab newsgroup.  You can read as well as post
     articles there.

     For specific help with the software, please consult the built-in
     help or the documentation for the package you're using.  Or contact
     your local systems administrator.


     If you have any questions, please e-mail them to: usenet@mathworks.com

   1. Nico Sneeuw said:

   First get a handle to your plotting command. Then you can change
   the markersize property.

   h = plot(x,y,'+')
   set(h,'MarkerSize',8)

Question: I want to make old lines disappear when new ones draw (they
          all are created by one constraint with different
          coefficients) in same figure, can I use plot? 

          I also want to plot a changing number in a figure window to
          reflect the real input, how to do this?

Answer from Sanjai Singh (The MathWorks, Inc.)

   Here is an example that can be modified to suit your need.

   for i = 1:10,                                  
       plot(rand(5,1));
       drawnow
       set(gcf,'numbertitle','off','name',int2str(i))
   end

  ----------------------

Question:  I want to create several plots within a loop and print to a file
           with the name created automatically including the loop
           variable, such as 

                print -deps pic_var_.eps

           where var is a loop variable. e.g.

                print -deps pic_1_.eps
                print -deps pic_2_.eps

           I tried 

                filename=['pic_' num2str(var) '_.eps']
                print -deps filename

           but that doesn't work.

  Thanks,

Answer from Sanjai Singh (The MathWorks, Inc)

    Your suggestion is very close ...the following should work.

    filename=['pic_' num2str(var) '_.eps'];
    eval(['print -deps ' filename])

Answer from Hans Olsson:

    Here's another way without using eval:

    filename=['pic_' num2str(var) '_.eps'];
    print('-deps',filename);

Question: Does anyone know how to make MATLAB produce the error beep
          without using the "error" function?  I'd like this to work
          on PC's without sound cards, so the MATLAB sound functions
          are not an option. 

   Thanks in advance!!!

Answer from Niclas

  The following works on UNIX workstations. I'm not sure about Windows,
  though...

       disp(sprintf('\a'))

  Cheers,

  /Niclas

   FYI - the above suggestion does indeed work on Windows, too.  

   On the Macintosh, however, neither the above suggestion nor "string(7)"
   agreement is  system compatible, so you would need to use this instead:   

        system_dependent(1001)

Question: 
   The demonstration "fitdemo" provides a curve-fitting algorithm to solve
   for
         y = c(1)*exp(-lam(1)*t) + c(2)*exp(-lam(2)*t)

   When the program finishes, it outputs the "lam" values.  However, for
   the formula to be useful, you need the "c" values, too...but the program
   does not output these.  Does anyone know where they can be found?

   Thanks,
   Greg Sandell

Answer:

   Hi Greg,

   The "c" valuess are computed via a simple linear least squares fit.

   Notice that the equation to be fit can be written:

      y = A*c

   where c = [c(1) .. c(length(lam))] and
      A = exp(-t*(lam'));     % re: size(A_t)=[length(t) length(lam)]

   Thus 

      c = A\y;

 REGUI is a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate comparing
 regression methods.  The Least Squares regression method is compared
 to the robust methods, Least Median of Squares (LMS) and Inner
 Product (IP).  The LMS program included is called Progress (Program
 for RObust reGRESSion). Users can add other methods as well. Several
 data sets are included in the DATA subdirectory.  Much of our
 interface was developed to facilitate the use of PROGRESS.  This
 program implements LMS and provides excellent diagnostics.  It was
 written for DOS in Fortran (Rousseeuw and Leroy 1987). Our interface
 is graphical with pull-down menus, with a point and click interface.
 If the user chooses certain default settings, there is very little
 typing.  All the data sets from Rousseeuw are included as well as the
 PROGRESS executable file.

SIMULINK-Based Questions & Answers

Question: How can I use "linmod" to determine time constants in
          SIMULINK models?

 I am trying to determine time constants for various models. I was thinking
 of using the linmod command, but that would require knowledge of the 
 values of the state variables at the operating point about which I am 
 linearizing the system. In order to get these values, I was going to 
 run the simulation from the command line using a flag 3 in order to get the
 values of the outputs (which I have set up to be the states) at the desired
 time. However, that would require giving the values of the states at the 
 time, but that is the information which I am trying to find. Any help with
 this matter would be appreciated - thanks in advance

 Zachary James Rubin
 rubin@pwrtrn1.me.wisc.edu

Answer: 

 To determine the equilibrium values of the states so that you can then 
 linearize the model about these equilibrium values, you use the function 
 "trim". The syntax is:

 % [x,u,y,dx]=trim('model',x0,u0,y0)

 where 'model' refers to model.m (your model M file) and x0,u0 and y0 are 
 initial guess values for the states, inputs and outputs, respectively.
 More information can be obtained from the MATLAB help pages.

 Hope this helps,

 gas-turbines, large compressors, boilers (including steam boilers), 
 steam distribution systems, pumps, heat exchangers, control valves, 
 condensers, process controls, etc.

 As in any simulation, the key is in knowing how you want to model 
 the various plant items, which items are to be modelled dynamically and 
 which algebraically, and to what level of detail. Implementing those 
 models into your chosen simulation environment (in this case SIMULINK) 
 requires a good working knowledge of the practicalities of the 
 chosen tool.

 In your application there are various possible techniques for 
 incorporating the necessary thermodynamics, including the possibility of 
 using the MATLAB interface to the InfoChem MultiFlash package.

Question: How do I use "get_param" in combination with masked blocks?

 I am fulfilling the last part of my graphical user interface and have
 been confronted with a small problem with the function get_param and
 the SIMULINK code. I have made a masked block of which I want to
 obtain the values. I have already succeeded for all the gain blocks in
 my SIMULINK scheme though not for the masked blocks. 

 To be more exact, I have created a masked block that has the
 parameters Td=@1;N=@2;h=@3. Now I want to obtain one of these values
 with get_param function. 

 Any help is welcome,

Answer: 


  try: 

    >>get_param('blockname','mask entries')

   For masks with mulitple entries, you probably want to parse the
   output, which ends up looking like 0\/1e-6\/ (each entry is separated
   by \/)

   You can also use:

   >>get_param(gcb,'mask entries')

   if the block is the current block

   HTH (hope this helps),

Question: How can I generate an impulse in SIMULINK?

 I am trying to input a unit impulse function to a transfer function
 with no luck.  I could not find a impulse function in the sources
 folder so I used a unit step into a derivative, but it didn't work.
 Can anyone help?


 Thanks from a newbe in the world of SIMULINK

Answer 1: 

 You can initialize the integrators to the value of the b vector
 of the system quadruple.. This will be the true impluse response
 if the system is linear with respect to the inputs. If there is a
 non-linear element from an input to a integrator, it is not clear what
 is the correct prodecure is.

Answer 2:

 For an impulse you should operate in the discrete domain, and, 
 as you tried (but probably in the continuous domain), cascade
 a discrete differentiator after a step: 

 step -->  (1-z^(-1))/1 

 This works fine given the restrictions in the discrete domain, 
 (0,0,1,0,0,0) and clearly implementing a dirac distribution will
 cause all sorts of practical problems.

Question: Why is memory not being freed from my C-MEX S-function?

  I'm having a problem with a C-MEX S-function model.  It does not appear to 
  execute the mdlTerminate function to clean up some memory I've allocated. 
  Checking ssGetTFinal returns 0 (?!), but the simulation runs to the
  proper point.  Is there anything I could have messed up that would cause
  this ? 
  After I tried playing around with it, I found that if I used a short 
  command line [t,x,y]=linsim('model',tfinal), the mdlTerminate
  function did get  executed, but it seemed like it was at the start,
  not the end.  Still got the memory leak message.  Normally I use a
  line like [t,x,y]=linsim('model',tfinal,x0,options,ut) and
  mdlTerminate never gets executed. Anybody have any ideas on
  what the problem is ? 

Answer: 

 Are the memory leak messages coming from MATLAB?  If so, I suspect that you
 are using mxCalloc.  If so, use malloc or calloc instead.  In order to
 improve performance, SIMULINK bypasses the normal MEX calling
 mechanism for MEX  S-functions. As a result, memory allocated via
 mxCalloc will not get freed upon return from the MEX file and MATLAB
 at a later point sees the memory on its allocation list but not freed
 and thus reports the error.

RIOTS_v.1.beta

 RIOTS is  a group of  programs and  utilities that solve  a very broad
 class of finite-horizon optimal control problems.  This class includes
 problems with:

  * Lagrange, Bolza and Mayer type objective functions
  * Linear or nonlinear dynamics
  * Min-Max objective functions
  * Free final time problems
  * Variable initial conditions
  * Endpoint equality and inequality constraints
  * Trajectory inequality constraints on the states and controls
  * Simple bounds on the controls and free initial conditions

 The user can supply objective, constraint, and dynamics functions  as
 either object code or M-files. Derivatives of theses functions should
 also be supplied.

 A complete  description  of RIOTS  is  contained in  the  RIOTS User's
 Manual (100 pages).  A postscript version of user's manual is available
 in the file 'manual.ps'.

 Some parts of RIOTS require other programs which the user must obtain.
 These programs are: LSODA, Linpack, and  either CFSQP or NPSOL.  RIOTS
 can  be  used on a  subset of  optimal control problems  without these
 programs.  This is explained in the manual.

 Top "6" Technical Notes

  1.) What C and Fortran compilers are supported by MATLAB, SIMULINK,
      and the MATLAB Compiler on the PC and the Mac?

 The following compilers are supported as of January 1996:

 PLEASE NOTE: Only the version numbers listed are supported.


 C Compilers Supported by the MATLAB Compiler and the MATLAB Math Library:

 MS-Windows

 To create MEX-files with the MATLAB Compiler, you must install and
 configure one of the following supported ANSI C compilers:

    o  WATCOM C version 10.0 or later
    o  MetaWare High C version 3.0 or later


 To create stand-alone external applications with the MATLAB Math
 Library, you must install any 32-bit ANSI C compiler that creates
 Win32 executables or Windows-NT console applications.  The MATLAB C
 Math Library supports two compilers: WATCOM 10.x and Microsoft Visual
 C++ 2.x.  Please refer to page 2-22 of the MATLAB C Math Library
 guide. 


 See page 2-5 of the MATLAB Compiler Guide.

 NOTE: To be able to execute 32-bit stand-alone executable
       applications, you must have WIN32S installed.  WIN32S is an extension
       to Windows 3.1 (which is a 16-bit operating system) that allows you to
       run some 32-bit applications.  Please refer to MS-Windows
       documentation for more information on WIN32S.


 Macintosh

 To create MEX-files or stand-alone external applications with the
 MATLAB Compiler, you must install and configure one of the following
 supported C compilers:

 Power Macintosh:
 MPW MrC 1.0b2
 MPW PPCC 1.0.5
 Metrowerks CodeWarrior C 7 (CodeWarrior 5 and 6 users should read the
 README  file in the "CodeWarrior 5-6" folder on the installation
 disk). 

 680x0 Macintosh:
 MPW C 3.4


 UNIX Workstations

 To create MEX-files or stand-alone external applications with the
 MATLAB Compiler, you must install and configure an ANSI C compiler.

 Note: The C Compiler that Sun provides with SunOS 4.1.X is not an ANSI
       C compiler. However, ANSI C compilers for this operating system
       are available from several vendors.

 To create stand-alone external applications, you must also install the
 MATLAB C Math Library.

     ********************

 The compilers listed below are supported by the MATLAB External
 Interface (e.g. when creating MEX-files, MAT-files and Engine
 programs).

 PC

 Compilers supported for V4.2 under MS-Windows 3.1

      o  Borland C++ 3.1 (for MATLAB versions v4.2, v4.2a, v4.2b only)
      o  Borland C++ 4.0
      o  Microsoft C version 8 (for MATLAB versions v4.2, v4.2a, v4.2b

         the C v8.0 compiler) 

  NOTE: Microsoft is no longer selling Microsoft Visual C++ 1.5
         (MSVC++ 1.5). However, the CD-ROM version of MSVC++ 2.0
         appears to come bundled with MSVC++ 1.5 as well.  MSVC++ 2.0
         is NOT supported in MATLAB v4.2c or prior versions. 

      o  Metaware High C 3.1 (requires Phar Lap linker v4.1 or v5.0) 
  engine is not supported for this compiler)
      o  Watcom C 9.5 (9.0 is not supported)
      o  Watcom C 10.0 (supported as of v4.2c but compatible CMEX
  libraries for prior MATLAB versions available via ftp)

  NOTE:  WATCOM offers two v9.5's of their compilers: 

      o  Watcom C v9.5 32-bit C compiler for DOS (not tested/may work)
      o  Watcom C v9.5 32-bit C++ compiler (supported)
      o  Microway NDP FORTRAN v4.4 (requires Phar Lap linker v4.1 or
         v5.0). 

 MATLAB V4.0 for Windows:

      o  Metaware High C 3.03 (requires Phar Lap linker v4.1 or v5.0)

      o  Microsoft C 8.0 (MATLAB for Windows v4.0 supports Microsoft
  Visual C++ (C 8.0) using the same settings as Microsoft C/C++
  7.0. When you set the location of the SDK in the CMEX.BAT
         file, set the SDK_ROOT to the location where Visual C++ has
         been installed.) 

 The Real Time Workshop and Accelerator (V1.0 for Windows)

  For Real Time Workshop:
     Watcom C 9.5 and 10.0
     MetaWare 3.1 (requires Phar Lap linker v4.1 or v5.0)

  For the Accelerator:
     Watcom C 9.5 and 10.0

     Microsoft Visual C++ 1.5

 Compilers supported for V4.2 under a Kanji NEC machine

     Watcom C 10.0
     Microsoft Visual C++ 1.5

 NOTES:

    1.  As noted in the SIMULINK release notes, page 1-11:

 Due to a special 32-bit parameter passing mechanism that is 
 used to optimize the performance of S-function MEX-files,
        16-bit DLL MEX-files compiled with Microsoft and/or Borland C
        compilers do not operate correctly and hence are unsupported
        in version 1.3 of SIMULINK."

    2.  Although C++ compilers are listed above, only standard C
 MEX-functions are supported.  C++ MEX-functions are not
        supported. 

 Other compilers

    o   Phar Lap linker (version v4.1 through v5.x) is also required for
 some non-Microsoft compilers, such as Metaware High C and
        Microway NDP FORTRAN.  (Note that Phar Lap linker version 6.0
        is not currently supported). 

    o   Microsoft Powerstation FORTRAN will not be supported until
        v5. We do not have any plans to support Microsoft FORTRAN v5.1
        since it is not a 32-bit compiler.

    o   FORTRAN 77 (F77): Several customers have tried to use this
 compiler but were unsuccessful due to incompatibilities in the
 library format. We use the Phar Lap linker REX format for our 
 FORTRAN libraries.  The Watcom F77 compiler supports these
        libraries but requires that you convert these libraries to
        another format, then link, and convert back.  We have not been
        able to make this work. 

 Additional Compiler Information

    o   The MathWorks does not recommend any one of the four supported
 C compilers over any of the others. We have gathered the
        following information about each compiler:

    1.  Metaware High C - Requires Phar Lap linker, making it more
 expensive to generate MEX-files.  However, it seems to compile
 faster, so users who do a lot of compiling while writing code,
 may be willing to pay the extra price.  Generates REX
 MEX-files, which are 32-bit code objects that are faster than
        16-bit code such as DLLs.

    2.  Watcom C - The linker that comes with Watcom C generates 32-bit
 REX MEX-files, so    the  Phar Lap  linker  is   not
        necessary. Code compilation may be slower than High C, but the
        MEX-files should run at about the same speed when called from
        MATLAB. 

    3.  Microsoft Visual C++ - generates 16-bit DLL MEX-files.  These
 are slower than REX MEX-files, and require a 32-to-16 bit
        interface between MATLAB and the code, which slows the code
        down further. However, DLL MEX-files allow access to Microsoft
        Windows's API, so things like standard dialog boxes, buttons,
        etc., can be generated and accessed from a DLL MEX-file.
        Other Dynamically Linked Libraries can also be accessed from a
        DLL MEX-file. 

    4.  Borland C++ - like Microsoft Visual C++, also generates 16-bit
 DLL MEX-files.  However, due to the fact that the Borland C
        compiler does not support the huge memory model for 16-bit
        DLLs, MATLAB variables in a MEX-file created with Borland are
        limited to 8192 elements.  However, the Borland compiler is
        usually cheaper, so there is a tradeoff between these two
        factors.

 2.) How can I save files with a '.m' extension under Windows 95?
     Everytime I try to save files with a '.m' extension, they show up
     having a '.txt' or '.m.txt' extension.

 In Windows 95, if you save a file with which has an unregistered
 extension, Notepad will automatically append the registered extension
 '.txt'.  If you register the '.m' extension, Notepad will no longer
 append the '.txt' extension.

 To register .m as a viable extension, please do the following:

 - open up 'My Computer'
 - click on the View menu
 - choose Options
 - choose the File Types tab
 - Select 'New Type'
 - type 'M-file' in the 'Description of type' field.
 - type '.m' in the 'Associated extension' field
 - click on 'New' to open the Actions window
 - type 'open with Notepad' in the Action field
 - Use the browse button to find NOTEPAD.EXE for the
   'Application used to perform action' field
 - click OK to close 'New Action' window
 - click OK to close the 'File Type' window

 This will allow you to save text files with a '.m' extension instead
 of a '.m.txt' extension.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------

 3.) Can I create multi-dimensional (3-D and N-D) arrays in MATLAB 4.x?

 There is no direct way to access more than two dimensions in MATLAB
 v4.x.  It is possible, however, to create your own functions in MATLAB
 to handle multi-dimensional arrays.  The following is an example that
 maps a three-dimensional array to a single vector.  The indices are
 passed to a function as if it is a 3-D array and they are then
 translated to a single vector with corresponding offsets.  The exact
 implementation will be specific to what you want to accomplish.

      o function position = index3(d,i,j,k)
      o % INDEX3   POSITION = INDEX3(d,i,j,k) indexes a 3-D array
      o % i,j, and k are the indices of interest.
      o % d is a 3-element vector that specifies the dimensions
      o % of the array.
      o % This function only works when your dimensions are equal. 
      o % e.g. a 3x3x3.
      o position = (i+(j-1)*d(2)+(k-1)*d(2)*d(3));

 The following is an example of how you might use this function.

      D = [3 3 3];               % D defines the dimensions as
     % 3x3x3
      A1 = [ 1  2  3;
      4  5  6;
      7  8  9];           % Set up the three arrays to 
     % stack
      A2 = [10 11 12;
     13 14 15;
     16 17 18];
      A3 = [19 20 21;
     22 23 24;
     25 26 27];
      A3D = [A1 A2 A3];          % A3D is where your 3-D data is
     % stored
      B1 = A3D(index3(D,1,3,2)); % 1st row, 3rd column, 2nd 
     % matrix
      A3D(index3(D,1,3,2)) = 77; % Write to it
      B2 = A3D(index3(D,1,3,2)); % Read from it

 It is possible to create N-dimensional arrays with different limits on
 each dimension.  The main difference is that the offset will change so
 that it correctly indexes through your matrix. Each additional
 dimension will require a corresponding offset.  You can add error
 checking for the indices to make sure you do not go out of bounds.

 You can also emulate 3-D arrays by packing them into 2-D arrays with
 the meshgrid function.  For example, given three arguments

      [X,Y,Z] = meshgrid(x,y,z)

 grids and packs the data into matrices like

      X = [X1(:) X2(:) X3(:) ...]

 where each Xi(:) is the gridded matrix for a fixed value of Z (a
 similar packed matrix is used for Y and Z).  That is, a m-by-n-by-p
 array is packed into a (m*n)-by-p matrix.

 The routine slice uses this packed format to display a "slice" through
 the data. The M-files for meshgrid and slice are short so if you study
 these you should be able to understand what is going on.  Since MATLAB
 only knows about the row and column dimensions you have to have an
 additional piece of information to determine the size of the 3-D array
 (slice uses the number of rows).

 We also do some 3-D packing for the image deck format in the Image
 Processing Toolbox.  If you have that toolbox, look at the routines
 imslice and montage.


 4.) Why does importing metafiles into MS Word or PowerPoint result in a graph
     with a black box over it?

 This problem is due to the fact that many graphics packages, to which
 MATLAB generated metafiles may be exported, do not provide the
 extensive support of MS-Windows graphics that is needed to accurately
 display MATLAB graphics.  Hence, when importing graphics into Word,
 PowerPoint or other Windows applications, the MATLAB graph can lose
 its color information (i.e. you get a black box over the graph).  As a
 workaround, MATLAB provides a function that limits metafile rendering
 to a lowest common denominator mode.

 Issue the command:

   system_dependent(14,'on')

 after you have displayed the plot and before copying it to the
 metafile.

 Please see page 85 of the MATLAB Release Notes for more information.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------

 5.) What are the system requirements for running MATLAB 4.2c under
     Linux? 

 MATLAB requires the Linux '95  V1.2 kernel configured to support ELF
 binaries. Detailed system requirements are available on The MathWorks
 FTP server:

      ftp.mathworks.com:/pub/tech-support/outgoing/linux/readme.lnx

 MATLAB 4.2c for Linux is available on The MathWorks CD-ROM Volume V
 and later, along with the images for the other supported UNIX
 platforms.  The CD-ROM is currently the only medium for delivering the
 Linux release.  If you are an existing UNIX customer and you want to
 run MATLAB for Linux, contact your sales representative for
 licensing options and to request the latest version of The MathWorks
 CD-ROM.

 For general sales and product information send e-mail to
 info@mathworks.com or call 508-647-7000.

 7.) Installing Notebook while running MS Word 7.0, produces the error
     message: WordBasic Err=582?

 Installing Notebook while running MS Word 7.0, produces the following
 error message:

   WordBasic Err=582

 Is there some problem in the DDE communication between MATLAB and
 Microsoft Word 7?

 Solution 

 The MATLAB Notebook Suite was designed with Microsoft Word version 6.
 Microsoft made some changes in Word 7.0 that affects the way Notebook
 works.

 There is a patch that you can download from our FTP site that should
 allow you to be able to use Word 7.0 with the Notebook Suite.  Please
 read the README file for instructions on how to install the patch and
 for any limitations it may have.   The patch can be found at

 This directory contains a set of M-files that perform the two
 phase simplex method.  The M-files are LINPROG, PHASEI and
 PHASEII. LINPROG is the core function, and it calls PHASEI and
 PHASEII as subroutines.  (PHASEI and PHASEII can also
 be run as independent functions.)  Each function provides a
 self-explanatory output display that includes reports on
 feasibility, optimality, unboundedness or cycling, as appropriate.
 Further, each M-file contains a substantial MATLAB "help" header.

     This subdirectory on the disk contains a collection of *.MAT
 files that contain some basic examples, two *.txt files that
 contain sample output, and the three M-files renamed with .DOC
 extensions to indicate that they are fully documented versions
 of the M-files.  The three M-files in this subdirectory are written
 to run under MATLAB 4.0.

 This directory contains a set of M-files that I have found useful for
 working on research problems in combinatorial matrix theory.  The
 most fundamental of these files are signs.m, which generalizes
 MATLAB's sign function, and signprod.m, which determines the
 generalized signs of the product of two vectors or matrices.  These
 files in conjunction with the battery of random matrix generators in
 the subdirectory in RANDOM provide a wide variety of signed matrices 
 with specified combinatorial properties, and the tools to
 examine the combinatorial properties of those matrices.

 The function rbdiag(A1,A2) generates a block diagonal matrix
 with diagonal blocks A1 and A2.  This M-file is designed for
 recursively generating a block diagonal matrix.  Thus
 rbdiag(A1,rbdiag(A2,rbdiag(A3,A4))) produces the block diagonal
 matrix whose diagonal blocks are  A1, A2, A3, A4  in that
 order.

       For convenience, rbdiag(A1) = A1.

 Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test for Unit Roots

 The usual t-statistics and F-statistics are not applicable to
 determine whether or not a sequence has a unit root.  Dickey and
 Fuller (1979, 1981) provide the appropriate test statistics to
 determine whether a series contains a unit root, unit root plus
 drift, and/or unit root plus drift plus a time trend.  The tests
 can also be modified to account for seasonal unit roots.  If the
 residuals of a unit root process are heterogeneous or weakly
 dependent, the alternative Phillips-Peffon test can be used.
 For the Dickey-Fuller test, one of the most important is to see
 if the process contains unit root with any drift and/or a time
 trend. Be aware that the statistical value t-statistics do
 depend on whether an intercept and/or time trend is included in
 the regression equation. In their Monte Carlo study, Dickey
 and Fuller (1979) found that the critical values for
  coefficient = 0 depend on the form of regression and sample
 size. As in most hypothesis tests, for any given level of
